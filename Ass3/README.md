## First Past the Post Voting implementation using Solidity
In this assignment we implemented this voting system with funtionalities like **approving voters, approving candidates, viewing candidates**

Since it was not very clear to us about what to keep private and what to keep public (like should the voters be public or private etc) so I declared them according to my ease.
